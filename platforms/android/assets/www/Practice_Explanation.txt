1- Show Movie list. Here I have connected to the movie database and printed the 
list of movies using ListView. What I show is: image, title and release date.
2- Movie details. When you click a movie of the list you go tho another page of the 
app getting its id. On this page the details of the movie are shown: Poster image, title,
release date, average mark of the reviewers and sypnosis of the movie.
3- Save movie. I have created a table using sqlite where the movie data is saved. 
To save a movie on your favorite list, you have to go to the details of that movie and then
click on the 'add to favorite' button that's on the bottom of that page. This action INSERTS
the movie data on our table. 
4- Show favorite movies. To see the list with your favorite movies you have to open the 
side menu and the click on 'Favorite movies'. On this page all your favorite movies are
shown, and you can delete them from the list using a button. This action DELETES the movie
of our table. 

What I haven't achieved: to mark favorite movies with a star image.
